                        <li>
                            A new recognition must be given to CEDAW * (The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women) to ensure that the sex- and gender-specific needs of girls and women in all areas of policy-making, research concerning education, empowerment skills, prevention and treatment of the harmful misuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, are addressed.</li>
                        <li>We urge that a Global Convention be developed concerning the production, distribution and marketing of alcohol with a strong gender Article.</li>
                        <li>We recommend that all countries develop guidelines to eliminate the targeted marketing of alcohol, tobacco and over-the-counter drugs to adolescents, young women and other vulnerable populations.</li>
                        <li>We recommend that the needs of indigenous/minority peoples be met with appropriate and accessible, gendered care and research.</li>
                        <li>We recommend that guidelines be re-inforced to ensure that all government funding of programmes or projects be gender-balanced and include the active representation and participation of girls/women.</li>
                        <li>We recommend that an action plan to ensure that treatment for women is respectful, gender and culturally specific, trauma-informed and is designed by women to meet the needs of girls/women.</li>
                        <li>We recommend that training curriculums for family physicians, social workers and others responding to the needs of girls/women include appropriate content to ensure that they acquire the knowledge, sensitivity and respect required to produce effective, non-judgemental, (client) person-centred interventions.</li>
                        <li>We recommend that an action plan to ensure the treatment, prevention, support and empowerment of mothers with young children be designed and implemented especially in response to research regarding childrenâ€™s brain development.</li>
                        <li>Finally, we recommend that each country continues their efforts to implement CEDAW and to examine all social service, medical and criminal justice practices to ensure that all women receive treatment based on social justice, respect and with full recognition of their cultural and gender needs.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><em>*The Convention defines discrimination against women as "...any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field."</em></p>
